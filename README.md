patterns.
### Business Objective:

business need is to automate filtering of misinformation and protect public trust by
developing a deployable classification model.
### Data Pipeline stages:
1. Data Preparation
2. Text Preprocessing
3. Train-Validation Split
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Feature Extraction using Word2Vec
6. Model Training
7. Model Evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
